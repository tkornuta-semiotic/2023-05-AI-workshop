# AI Workshop with Semiotic Labs
## May 5th 2023

This repository contains materials (notebooks and a presentation) associated with
"AI Workshop with Semiotic Labs" organized @ Edge&Node's House of Web3 on May 5th 2023.

# Abstract
The workshop will consist of two parts. In the first part we will do a brief introduction, explaining what we understand as intelligence and what artificial intelligence is. We will do a brief history of how AI emerged, we will explain what the domains of AI are and what Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning are. We will focus then on the latter, go through some of the most important turning points in the history of Neural Networks, from Rosenblatt’s perceptron up to OpenAI’s ChatGPT that recently became a phenomenon on a global scale. We will summarize the talk by high-lighting selected emerging problems and future research directions.

In the second part we will do a hands-on tutorial, focusing on two hello-world deep-learning tasks. In the first task we will focus on the Computer Vision (CV) domain and build and train a simple neural network able to recognize images. In the second part we will implement one of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) classical tasks and build a text classifier able to distinguish different types of news. 

# Requirements
An elementary knowledge of Python will be required. Understanding of Pandas and PyTorch packages is not required, but for sure will be useful. Both hands-on tutorials are based on Google Colab.

# Audience
This workshop addresses the audience interested, but not very familiar with Machine Learning/Deep Learning. Along with the world-wide adoption of Generative AI techniques and applications, most people focus now on the prompting techniques, treating the underlying neural network models as black boxes. The goal of this workshop is to dive a little bit deeper and enable participants to develop intuition through hands-on experience with the models.
